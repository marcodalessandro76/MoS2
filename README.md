Analysis of the quasi-particle band structure and electronic excitations in MoS2

TO DO :

1) Compute the optical and XUV abs spectrum for the MoS2 bulk. We use the input file
   proivded by Maurizia and compute the DFT band structure. We compare it with the experimental
   result and extract the value of the scissor. We compute the screening and finally we perform
   the BSE analysis.
